# Battlefield - Console Game :boat:

This is an ***unfinished*** and ongoing project! 

My first goal is to make an easier version of this game with only one game field with four hidden boats. 
The user goal is to uncover all boats in as few moves as possible.

Things that I want to practice how to get done with this project: 
- Highscore that creates and saves ten top players/highscores
- A function that randomizes the ships at the beginning
- The use of 3d array

When these parts are done, I might add CPU to play against.
