# Battleship - Console Game :boat:

This is an ***unfinished*** and ongoing project! 

My goal is to make an easier version of this game with only one game field with four hidden boats. 
The players goal is to uncover all boats in as few moves as possible.

(The player does not have it's own gamefield and won't get shot at by the CPU)

## Things that I want to practice how to get done with this project: 
- Highscore that creates and saves ten top players/highscores
- A function that randomizes the ships and places them in the hidden game field
- The use of two-layerd array (one for seeing and one for the boats to hide within)



## The id√©a is this: 
1. First you see this field with the sea uncovered and you are asked to put in a number for columns and a letter for rows to aim.
2. You'll see if you hit a ship, because the field will be marked with an X. Then you get to aim again.
3. This repeats until you have uncovered all the enemy ships. Then you get to write your name and the score will be saved in a file.


#### Here is the basic layout wich I took inspiration from [Battleship Game In C# Console](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/battleship-game-in-c-sharp-console-part-1) (The code in this repo is my own though)
![Game field](https://github.com/Bubbelbad/BattlefieldConsoleApp/blob/master/Screenshot%202023-10-30%20004901.png?raw=true)

Eventually I'll add so that you are playing against the CPU, with your own field of boats when I get all this to work.
